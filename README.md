# node-stratum-pool-sha256

High performance SHA-256 Stratum poolserver in Node.js - modernized for Node.js 18+ with zero vulnerabilities.

This is a SHA-256 optimized fork of the original [node-stratum-pool](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool) that has been fully modernized with comprehensive security fixes, modern JavaScript features, complete test coverage, and zero native dependencies.

#### Notice
This is a module for Node.js that will do nothing on its own. Unless you're a Node.js developer who would like to
handle stratum authentication and raw share data then this module will not be of use to you. For a full featured portal
that uses this module, see [NOMP (Node Open Mining Portal)](https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal). It
handles payments, website front-end, database layer, mutli-coin/pool support, auto-switching miners between coins/pools,
etc.. The portal also has an [MPOS](https://github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) compatibility mode so that the it can function as
a drop-in-replacement for [python-stratum-mining](https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining).

## Key Improvements in this Fork

    "name": "BitcoinCash",
    "symbol": "BCH",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "asicboost": true,  // Enable ASICBoost support
    "peerMagic": "e3e1f3e8",
    "peerMagicTestnet": "f4e5f3f4"
};

// Bitcoin (without ASICBoost)
var myCoin = {
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "asicboost": false,
    "peerMagic": "f9beb4d9",
    "peerMagicTestnet": "0b110907"
};
```

### ðŸš€ Performance & Compatibility

### ðŸŽ¯ Solo Pool Optimizations
This fork is optimized for solo pool operations. For a complete solo pool setup, see [NOMP-BCH](https://github.com/skaisser/nomp-bch) which includes:
- Lightweight API server (no Express dependency)
- Simplified initialization without profit switching
- Minimal dependencies for better performance
- Pre-configured for Bitcoin Cash solo mining
- Per-miner coinbase signatures (shows "Mined by [username]" in blockchain)

### ðŸ’° Enhanced Address Support
Full support for multiple address formats:
- **Legacy addresses** (e.g., `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`)
- **CashAddr format** (e.g., `bitcoincash:qpm2qsznhks23z7629mms6s4cwef74vcwvy22gdx6a`)
- **Bech32 addresses** for SegWit coins
- **Automatic format detection and conversion**
- **Multi-coin address validation**

#### Why
This server was built to be more efficient and easier to setup, maintain and scale than existing stratum poolservers
which are written in python. Compared to the spaghetti state of the latest
[stratum-mining python server](https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining/), this software should also have a
lower barrier to entry for other developers to fork and add features or fix bugs.


Features
----------------------------------
* Daemon RPC interface
* Stratum TCP socket server
* Block template / job manager
* P2P to get block notifications as peer node
* Optimized generation transaction building
* Connecting to multiple daemons for redundancy
* Process share submissions
* Session managing for purging DDoS/flood initiated zombie workers
* Auto ban IPs that are flooding with invalid shares
* __POW__ (proof-of-work) & __POS__ (proof-of-stake) support
* Transaction messages support
* Vardiff (variable difficulty / share limiter)
* When started with a coin deamon that hasn't finished syncing to the network it shows the blockchain download progress and initializes once synced
* __ASICBoost__ support for version rolling (up to 20% efficiency improvement)

#### Supported Algorithms:

This fork supports **SHA-256 only**:
* âœ“ __SHA256__ (Bitcoin [BTC], Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Bitcoin SV [BSV], Namecoin [NMC], Peercoin [PPC], and other SHA256 coins)
* âœ“ __SHA256 with ASICBoost__ (Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Bitcoin [BTC] - with BIP320 version rolling support)

All other algorithms have been removed to maintain zero native dependencies and ensure cross-platform compatibility.


Requirements
------------
* node v18.0+
* coin daemon (preferably one with a relatively updated API and not some crapcoin :p)

#### Module usage

Create the configuration for your coin:

This fork supports `algorithm`: **sha256** only.

```javascript
// Bitcoin Cash Configuration
var myCoin = {
    "name": "BitcoinCash",
    "symbol": "BCH",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "asicboost": true,      // Enable ASICBoost support for version rolling
    "txMessages": false,    // Optional - defaults to false

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications.
       Found in the daemon source code as the pchMessageStart variable. */
    "peerMagic": "e3e1f3e8",        // BCH mainnet magic
    "peerMagicTestnet": "f4e5f3f4"  // BCH testnet magic
};

// Bitcoin Configuration
var myCoin = {
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "asicboost": false,     // Bitcoin Core doesn't support ASICBoost by default
    "txMessages": false,
    "peerMagic": "f9beb4d9",
    "peerMagicTestnet": "0b110907"
};

// Other SHA-256 coins follow the same pattern
var myCoin = {
    "name": "Namecoin",
    "symbol": "NMC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "peerMagic": "f9beb4fe"
};
```


Create and start new pool with configuration options and authentication function

```javascript
var Stratum = require('stratum-pool');

var pool = Stratum.createPool({

    "coin": myCoin,

    "address": "mi4iBXbBsydtcc5yFmsff2zCFVX4XG7qJc", //Address to where block rewards are given

    /* Block rewards go to the configured pool wallet address to later be paid out to miners,
       except for a percentage that can go to, for examples, pool operator(s) as pool fees or
